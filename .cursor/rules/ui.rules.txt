# UI Components Rules
Description: For UI components, ensure that:
- Components follow established UI patterns as defined in the projectâ€™s style guide or component library.
- Tailwind CSS classes are used consistently for styling.
- Utility classes are merged with the `cn` function from src/lib/utils.
- Code is responsive and adheres to accessibility best practices (WCAG guidelines).
- Components are well-documented with clear prop type definitions.
- Favor composition over inheritance.
File Pattern: **/components/ui/**/*.tsx, **/components/**/*.tsx
