# CI/CD Rules
Description: All code commits must pass linting, testing (unit, integration, end-to-end), and build steps as defined in the GitHub Actions workflow. Maintain an up-to-date CI configuration. Automate deployments to staging and production environments, and monitor build/deployment processes for failures.
