# State Management Rules
Description: Prefer local component state using useState or useReducer where appropriate. For more complex state needs, consider using:
- Context API for global state (e.g., theme, auth).
- Zustand or Redux Toolkit for complex scenarios.
Avoid overusing global state to keep components decoupled.
File Pattern: **/components/**/*.tsx, **/app/**/*.tsx, **/pages/**/*.tsx
