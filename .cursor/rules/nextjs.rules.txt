# Next.js Specific Rules
Description: When editing Next.js files, ensure that:
- Components that use hooks include the "use client" directive.
- Server components do not use hooks.
- The file structure follows the Next.js app directory (or pages directory) conventions.
- Built-in optimizations (like <Image>, next/link, and dynamic imports) are utilized.
- API routes are used for server-side logic where appropriate.
- The Metadata API is utilized for SEO.
File Pattern: **/app/**/*.tsx, **/app/**/*.ts, **/pages/**/*.tsx, **/pages/**/*.ts
