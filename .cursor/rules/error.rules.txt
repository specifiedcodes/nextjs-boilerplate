# Error Handling Rules
Description: Use Sentry for error tracking and implement Error Boundaries to gracefully catch and display runtime errors. Ensure that:
- Errors are logged with sufficient context for debugging.
- Different error types (e.g., network errors, validation errors) are handled specifically.
File Pattern: **/components/**, **/pages/**, **/app/**
