# Performance Optimization Rules
Description: Optimize performance by:
- Using Next.js <Image> for optimized image rendering.
- Employing code splitting (dynamic imports) to reduce initial load time.
- Memoizing components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Profiling the application to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.
File Pattern: **/components/**/*.tsx, **/app/**/*.tsx, **/pages/**/*.tsx
