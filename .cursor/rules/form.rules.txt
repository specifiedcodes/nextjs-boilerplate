# Form Management Rules
Description: When implementing forms, always use react-hook-form for state management and zod for validation. Ensure that:
- Form elements have proper labels and accessibility features.
- Errors are handled gracefully with clear user feedback.
- Consider using controlled components where necessary for complex logic.
File Pattern: **/components/**/*.tsx
