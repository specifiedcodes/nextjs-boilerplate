# Testing Rules
Description: Write comprehensive tests:
- Unit tests for individual components and functions.
- Integration tests to ensure different parts of the application work together correctly.
- End-to-end tests to simulate real user interactions.
Aim for high test coverage. Use Jest and React Testing Library as the standard testing framework.
File Pattern: **/tests/**, **/*.test.ts, **/*.test.tsx
